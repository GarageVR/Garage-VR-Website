    <h2>Welcome to GarageVR</h2>

    <p>
        At GarageVR, we're not just game developers; we're a team passionate
        about creating virtual experiences. Founded in late 2022, we're a young
        but enthusiastic group exploring the exciting world of virtual reality.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        Our team consists of experienced professionals in different areas,
        coming together to explore the endless possibilities of VR. Virtual
        reality is not just where we work; it's our playground, where creativity
        has no limits.

        Our journey started with a shared love for VR and a common goal: to
        redefine gaming experiences. In April 2023, we introduced our first
        creation, "Mansion Mystery," a proof of concept that showed our
        commitment to pushing boundaries.Encouraged by the response, we swiftly
        moved on to our next project. "Grill on Wheels," our second release in
        October 2023, has already captured the hearts of 10,000 players in its
        first month.

    <p>
        This achievement is a testament to our dedication and a celebration of
        the vibrant community supporting our vision. As a small but dynamic
        indie game development studio, we believe VR is not just a platform;
        it's a canvas for crafting unforgettable adventures. Join us on this
        exciting journey as we continue to pioneer, create, and immerse you in
        the amazing world of virtual realities. Thank you for being part of our
        story.
